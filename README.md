## About Application
The application was originally intended to be a hybrid client for a sub/pub model application layer protocol.

## Required Permissions
Network access

## Known Prolems:
#### The client is only capable of publishig, for now.
#### Have made some changes to the code, but no longer have the server code, my friend lost it. So, the changes have not been tested.
